# Logic Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Logic project! This project contains various utility methods.
Your task is to implement the methods defined in this project.

## Methods to Implement
The following methods need to be implemented:

1. **MathOperations**
   - `GetFactorial(int n)`: Calculates the factorial of a given number `n`.

2. **StringManipulations**
   - `Reverse(string input)`: Reverses the given string `input`.
   - `CapitalizeWords(string input)`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the given string `input`.
   - `IsPalindrome(string input)`: Checks if the given string `input` is a palindrome.

3. **ListManipulation**
   - `CountLessThan(int[] sortedArray, int lessThan)`: Takes a sorted array of unique integers and counts the elements that are less than the parameter `lessThan`.

## Assessment Criteria
Your implementation will be assessed based on the following criteria:

1. **Correctness**
   - The methods should return the correct results as specified in the test cases.

2. **Code Quality**
   - The code should be clean, readable, and well-documented.
   - Follow best practices and coding standards.

3. **Performance**
   - The methods should be optimized for performance, especially for large inputs.

4. **Testing**
   - Ensure that all provided test cases pass.
   - Add additional test cases to cover edge cases and ensure robustness.
